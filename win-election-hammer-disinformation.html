            <p>This is John Kerry, no less, in a World Economic Forum discussion, no
less, saying that:</p>
<ul>
<li>“It’s really hard to govern today” because of the “problem … of
building consensus”.</li>
<li>This because people “self-select where they go for their news”.</li>
<li>There is “a lot of discussion now about how you curb those entities”
providing such news.</li>
<li>“… our First Amendment stands as a major block to the ability to be
able to just, you know, hammer [disinformation] out of existence”.</li>
<li>The solution is to “win the right to govern” in “this election” so
we can “implement change”.</li>
<li>But he worries whether democracies have the ability to implement
these changes “fast enough, big enough”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you, dear voter, want to use your vote to give John Kerry and his
colleagues more power to hammer disinformation, so they can build
consensus, and make it easier to govern?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Questioner: … Could perhaps Secretary Kerry and the panelists could
expand on the role of tackling climate misinformation on the solutions
in the marketplace, ’cause that seems to me that it’s rife out there
both from business investment and consumer.</p>
<p>Kerry: It’s so tough, everybody is wrestling with that right now. And
I think the dislike of, and anguish over social media, is just growing
and growing and growing. And it’s part of our problem, particularly in
democracies, in terms of building consensus around any issue. It’s
really hard to govern today. You can’t, you know there’s no .. the
referees we used to have to determine what’s a fact, and what isn’t a
fact, the kind of … have been eviscerated to a certain degree. And
people go and people self-select where they go for their news and for
their information, and then you just get into a vicious cycle. So it’s
really, really hard, much harder to build consensus today, than at any
time in the 45-50 years I’ve been involved in this. And there’s a lot of
discussion now about how you curb those entities in order to guarantee
that you’re going to have some accountability on facts, etc. But look,
if people go to only one source, and the source they go to is sick, and,
you know, has an agenda, and they’re putting out disinformation, our
First Amendment stands as a major block to the ability to be able to
just, you know, hammer it out of existence, so what you need, what we
need is to win the ground, win the right to govern, by hopefully having,
winning enough votes that you’re free to be able to implement change.
Now obviously there are some people in this country who are prepared to
implement change in other ways, and that’s really dangerous.</p>
<p>Interviewer: So you’re questioning really for democracy can survive
unregulated social media?</p>
<p>Kerry: I think democracies are deeply, very challenged right now, and
have not proven they can move fast enough or big enough to deal with the
challenges that we are facing. And to me that is part of what this race,
this election is all about — will we break the fever in the United
States, will we bring ourselves back to a regular order as John McCain
used to say, where we’re able to get things done — like a budget — pass
a budget for God’s sake.</p>
<p>When I travel around the world, I’m pounded by people who say “What’s
the matter with America?” or “Where the hell are you guys going?” And
you all know — I’m not raising anything new — it doesn’t look good, it’s
not working well. And we have to be able to … and I’ve heard this from
leaders of other countries, I won’t mention their names, but some of
them semi-adversarial, and they don’t think our system works very well,
and you look at it and you say, well maybe …</p>
