**Warning : this page refers in a general way to
a legal case involving sex with children. Though the
facts are ugly, I believed it important to document
some reactions to the case, as insight into the
world-view of some influential thinkers in 1970s
France.**

This is, in some way, an example of the ["irresponsibility ... of the liberal
community"]({filename}wicked-and-dangerous-fraud.pdc) that James Baldwin
complained of.

The Versailles Affair was a French legal case from
1977 in which three men [aged 39 to
45](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_petition_against_age_of_consent_laws),
were prosecuted for having sex with male and female
children aged 13 and 14. Many important intellectuals,
including the founders of post-modernism, publicly
supported the immediate release of these men for time
served, and repeal or revision of the law that allowed
prosecution of adults for sex with consenting
children.

As ever, I am trying to be as fair as possible to the
original sources, by quoting them at length, with
minimal elision, and in context.  I'm happy to hear
any suggestions of ways I could do better at that.

This is a translation [^hybrid-translation] from the [French Wikipedia page on the Versailles Affair](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affaire_de_Versailles):

> # The case
>
> Bernard Dejager, Jean-Claude Gallien and Jean
Burckhardt were arrested on October 20, 1973 for
having had sexual intercourse with girls and boys aged
13 and 14. The circumstances were sufficiently unclear
that the investigation lasted more than three years
and two months. The acts allegedly took place at the
Camping Club de France de Meudon, the oldest
specialized camping club in France, located in the
Forest of Meudon, which has various groups, including
a naturist group.
>
> The three men appeared before the Assize Court of
Versailles for "indecent assault without violence on
minors aged 15", which, at the time, qualified as
a crime. Over the course of investigation it seemed
that they were at risk of five to ten years in prison.
>
> # Matzneff's op-ed, then the petition of support for the accused.
>
> On November 8, 1976, in the newspaper Le Monde, the
writer Gabriel Matzneff published an op-ed in support
of the accused, titled “Is love a crime?, in which he
complains bitterly about the lack of support he
received after his appearance on "Apostrophes",
Bernard Pivot's new TV show, on September 12, 1975,
for which had been severely criticized. He had received a complaint from
a viewer who believed that this justification for pedophilia had harmed his
family.
>
> Two and a half months later, the three defendants
elicited a petition of support that emphasized the
fact that they had been in preventive detention for
three years and two months. The petition is signed by
various public figures: the text affirms that the
children suffered "no violence", and that they were
"consenting", adding furthermore: "if a girl of
thirteen is entitled to the pill, what is that for?".
The petition asserts that the tenacity with which the
three accused were being prosecuted was
disproportionate: “Three years in prison for caresses
and kisses, that is enough". The petitioners, who
include well-known intellectuals, consider there is
a clear disproportion between the classification of
"crime" that justifies such severity, and the nature
of the alleged offenses.

Several famous intellectuals were signatories, [such
as](https://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/index2.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lemonde.fr%2Farchives%2Farticle%2F1977%2F01%2F26%2Fa-propos-d-un-proces_2854399_1819218.html#federation=archive.wikiwix.com)
Gilles Deleuze, Roland Barthes, Simone de Beauvoir,
Jean-Paul Sartre and Félix Guattari.

Later, some of the same people signed a [petition to
the French
parliament](https://www.dolto.fr/fd-code-penal-crp.html)
that cites the case as an example of legal excess. The
petition calls for the law to be repealed or changed
to make it legal for children to have sex with adults
or other children.  Here I have quoted the beginning
and end of the petition:

> # Open letter to the Commission for the Revision of the Penal Code supporting the revision of some legislative instruments governing the relations between adults and minors
>
> Relationships between children, adolescents and
adults are subject to significant restrictions by law:
by the notion of “corruption of minors”
(which can consist of a simple single overnight stay
of a minor); by the general ban on having sexual
relations with children under the age of 15; or by the
special ban that targets homosexual relations with
minors aged 15 to 18, defined as “immodest or against
nature ”.
>
> The obsolescence of the notions underlying these
crimes or misdemeanors (“modesty”, “nature”), the
evolution of mores in a youth who feel the excesses of
fastidious segregation as oppressive, mean that these
legal articles are no more than the instrument of
coercion, in place of a guaranteed right.
>
> A recent case has just clearly shown the
disproportion between the criminal apparatus and the
nature of the acts it punishes. After more than three
years of preventive detention, three people accused of
“indecent assault committed or attempted without
violence on the person of children of either sex aged
under 15”, acts that the law (article 331 §1 of the
Penal Code) qualifies as “crimes”, were sentenced by
the Court of Assizes of Yvelines to 5 years in prison,
suspended.
>
> ...
>
> The signatories of this letter ... believe, more
generally, that the provisions claiming to "protect"
children and young people, such as article 334-1
concerning "the incitement of minors to debauchery",
which make it possible to charge anyone who “promotes”
or “facilitates” sexual relations between minors, or
article 356 concerning the “abuse of minors”, are,
like article 331, increasingly incompatible with the
evolution of our society, justifying harassment and
straightforward police control, and must be repealed,
or profoundly modified, in order to recognize the
right of children and adolescents to maintain
relations with persons of their choice.

The 80 signatories included Michel Foucault, Gilles
Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes, Simone de
Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre, Félix Guattari and
Jean-François Lyotard.
