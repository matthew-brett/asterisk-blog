Summary: Something that looks like understanding
---

I've spend the last two years doing a reasonable amount of teaching.

I suppose that every teacher wonders whether the students are really
"understanding" what we teach.  This begs the question of what we mean by
understanding.

One effect of doing a lot of teaching, has been that I have found that I
did not understand some things that I thought I did understand.  A particular
example is Principal Components Analysis (PCA).  I think I do understand it
now, but I did not before.  I have taught something about PCA in the past, and
I think I was saying things that were true, but I didn't know why they were
true.

What had happened was that I had heard other people that I trust say these
things about PCA.  I heard the same thing a few times from a few different
people, and I added what they said to the store of things I "knew".

In my case, I think I was using what Perkins, Allen and
Hafner call "makes-sense epistemology" ([^perkins-allen-hafner]).  Someone
using makes-sense epistemology is not reasoning or criticizing what they have
heard. They are not asking "could that be wrong?".  Their criterion for
accepting an argument is that the argument feels right or makes sense.

It seems to me that teachers are often in the situation where they cannot or
do not hope to teach the students why something *is* true, but only give them
a *feeling* for why something *might be* true.  When we do this, we encourage
makes-sense epistemology.

Does it matter that we often function on this intuitive makes-sense level? Not
if we think that most of what we are told is true.  But, as Richard Feynman
put it: "Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts." ([^ignorance]).
