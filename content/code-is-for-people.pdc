[Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) gave
[something like a TED
talk](http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2016/04/kings-day-speech.html) on the
history of Python.  He explains why it is so important that code is easy to
read and understand:

> Typically when you ask a programmer to explain to a lay person what a
> programming language is, they will say that it is how you tell a computer
> what to do. But if that was all, why would they be so passionate about
> programming languages when they talk among themselves?
>
> In reality, programming languages are how programmers express and communicate
> ideas â€” and the audience for those ideas is other programmers, not computers.
