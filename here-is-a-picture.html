            <p>Here is a picture of the strangely informal world of the British Government during the war.<br />
<br />
Alan Turing and others at Bletchley park were having trouble getting the resources they needed to do their work on decryption.  They wrote a letter to Churchill and deputized Stuart Milner-Barry of Hut 6 to deliver it by hand to 10 Downing street (the terraced house where the British Prime-Minister lives and works).  This is Milner-Barry's account of that trip:<br />
<br />
"Why I was deputed to carry the letter to No. 10 I do not remember—at a guess, because I was the most readily expendable from the scene of action. What I do recall is arriving at Euston Station, hailing a taxi, and with a sense of total incredulity (can this really be happening?) inviting the driver to take me to 10 Downing Street. The taxi-driver never blinked an eyelid: without comment he directed himself to Whitehall. Arrived at the entrance to Downing Street, I was again surprised at the lack of formality: there was just a wooden barrier across the road, and one uniformed policeman who waved my driver on. At the door to No. 10 I paid off the taxi, rang the bell, was courteously ushered in, explained that I had an urgent letter which I was anxious to deliver to the Prime Minister personally, and was invited to wait. Of course I did not see the Prime Minister himself; but very shortly there appeared a dapper dark-suited figure of shortish stature whom I subsequently identified as Brigadier Harvie-Watt, Mr. Churchill’s PPS [Parliamentary Private Secretary] from 1941 to 1945. To him I again explained my errand; and while obviously and understandably puzzled as to who I might be and what this was all about, he took me sufficiently seriously to promise that he would without fail deliver the letter to the Prime Minister and stress its urgency. That accomplished, I took my leave and took myself back to Bletchley by the next train."<br />
<br />
The next day Churchill wrote to his chief of staff: "ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this had been done".<br />
