<h2>Easy and simple</h2>
<p>I am going to use the definitions of “simple” and “easy” from <a
href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">this
talk</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple comes from Latin <em>simplex</em> - one fold. Simple is the
opposite of <em>complex</em>, which comes from the Latin for “twisted
together”.</li>
<li>Easy comes from old French <em>aiser</em> which in turn comes from
the Latin <em>adjacens</em> “lying close by” (<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>“Easy” is what you are familiar with. “Easy” is not far from
something you already know.</p>
<p>“Simple” is when you have succeeded in breaking the problem into
separate component ideas.</p>

<section id="easy-tools-simple-tools" class="level2">
<h2>Easy tools, simple tools</h2>
<p>I use a general-purpose text editor for as many tasks as I can. For
the last six years I have used Vim and Gvim; before that, I used Emacs.
Like many powerful text editors, Vim and Emacs can be configured for
editing many different types of text files, including code in different
languages. For example, I am using Vim to edit this text in Markdown
format; Vim does Markdown syntax highlighting.</p>
<p>I had been using Emacs in this way for a long time before I read this
advice in the classic book “The Pragmatic Programmer” by Andrew Hunt and
David Thomas (2000):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Use a Single Editor Well</em></p>
<p>The editor should be an extension of your hand; make sure your editor
is configurable, extensible, and programmable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I have a task that needs thought, I often sketch the code or
text on a piece of paper, then fill out the sketch in Vim. For example,
I wrote the first draft of this post in an art notebook with large
pages, and now I am typing it up and editing in Vim.</p>
<p>I use Vim to read and write:</p>
<ul>
<li>code in Python, C and MATLAB;</li>
<li>papers or reference letters using LaTeX;</li>
<li>tutorials in Restructured Text;</li>
<li>presentations in Markdown / LaTeX;</li>
</ul>
<p>To execute code I use the terminal command line, or the IPython
Python interpreter, which is also a terminal application. I use
command-line tools like <code>make</code> to build my papers and
presentations. In the days when I used MATLAB daily, I preferred to
start it in <code>-nodesktop</code> mode, to disable most of the
graphical user interface.</p>
<p>Very occasionally I use a specialized tool for a short task that does
not need much thought. For example I sometimes use LibreOffice or OSX
Pages to write short letters, Keynote for a presentation with many
graphics, or the Jupyter notebook when I am experimenting with plots in
Python, or when I am writing a demonstration of code I already
understand.</p>
<p>As soon as the task needs some thought, I switch into my text editor.
I do this to relieve myself of the burden of using the richer and more
complicated interfaces of the other tools. I am very familiar with my
text editor, so I no longer have to think how to do things like editing
text. With Vim, in particular, I find that the cursor seems to follow my
eyes; I have little or no conscious sensation of what my hands are
typing as they enter the commands to move the cursor.</p>
<p>I am sure I am not alone in finding it hard to think clearly. If you
give me an interface that makes it easy to play with code in a sloppy
and unstructured way, I will. Sometimes doing that is useful, but most
of the time, giving in to the temptation to play with code is disastrous
for my clarity of thought.</p>
<p>I think more clearly in Vim because I have used Vim enough that my
hands and my motor cortex can do the mechanical work of editing, leaving
the rest of my brain free for thinking (<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>). I
do not have to interrupt my concentration by moving my hands to the
mouse or trackpad, because I can do everything I need with the keyboard
commands. Using my text editor is simple, because the task of editing is
not entangled with the task of thinking.</p>

<h2>Easy and simple in teaching</h2>
<p>When we teach scientists to write and use code, new students are
unlikely to know a general-purpose text editor well, and may never have
used a terminal application. It does not seem practical for them to
learn to use an editor and the terminal as well as the other new things
we teach. For that reason, many courses give students an easy
interactive environment such as the MATLAB workspace, R Studio or the
Jupyter Notebook. The idea is that it makes it easier for the students
to concentrate on code rather than learning how to use the tools. In my
experience, the students often continue using the easy tools from the
class, and do not go on to learn the simple tools that experts use.</p>
<p>Some teachers do not believe that their students should be using the
same tools as the experts. The argument is that scientists use and write
code in a different way from programmers, so they do not need the tools
that a programmer would choose. If that argument were correct, that
would be happy for teachers, because the simple tools are hard to
teach.</p>
<p>I chose my tools to help me think clearly. Does a scientist using
code need less clarity of thought than a programmer? Your answer to this
will probably depend on your model of scientific practice. If you think
that a scientist should spend most of their time exploring code and data
in an informal way, you might conclude that “easy” is acceptable, even
desirable. My own experience of using tools like the Jupyter Notebook is
that I cannot afford to work in this way without exposing myself to
great risk from ubiquitous error and self-deception (<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>).
If your experience of science is like mine, you will probably prefer
“simple”.</p>
<p>You might accept that scientists do need to learn the simple tools at
some point, but the constraints of your course do not allow you to spend
time on teaching tools. Teaching the simple tools, would take too long.
In that case you have to consider the potential for damage to the
students’ practice over the long term. If a student sees their teachers
using easy tools, and encouraging them to do the same, they are less
likely to commit themselves to the hard work necessary to learn the
simple tools. To quote a friend and colleague: “It would be terrible if
we make a generation of copy-paste scientists”.</p>
<p>As I have taught more, I have put more effort into introducing
students to the simple tools right at the beginning of my course. I want
to teach students tools that I would use myself. We use the terminal to
run bash and git commands, the IPython console for exploring small code
fragments, and a full-featured text editor for editing code and
documents. In my <a
href="https://bic-berkeley.github.io/psych-214-fall-2016">most recent
course</a> we used the Atom text editor. Sometimes I do use the Jupyter
Notebook for my own work, but I am careful not to use it in class,
because it is so addictive, and therefore dangerous for someone new to
coding.</p>
</section>
<section id="teach-simple-not-easy" class="level2">
<h2>Teach simple, not easy</h2>
<p>Teaching always involves some degree of instruction that is implicit.
The students take our working practice as a model of expertise. This
model can be more more persuasive than anything else we teach. We should
use implicit and explicit learning to teach effective practice. Sound
working practice is the foundation on which we build; it is worth the
cost in curriculum time to show the benefit of simple, and the risks of
easy.</p>
