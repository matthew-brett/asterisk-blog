&lt;p&gt;Forks are experiments in open-source management (&lt;sup id="fnref:oss-why-fork"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:oss-why-fork" rel="footnote"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management in open-source can mysterious. In our technical world, we would
rather believe that anything important must be technical, and management seems
soft and poorly defined. We want to believe that all you need is good code,
and that management is for corporate types, whom we despise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fork is interesting because it usually comes about when one group of
developers thinks that they can do a better job managing a project than the
current group in charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group doing the fork takes a risk, because forking is violation of the
code of honor. The group will probably have to start under a new project and
package name, and then compete with the old project for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the fork fails and the old project succeeds, it is difficult to draw
conclusions about which project had better management, because of the inertia
bias against the fork.  If both fail, the project may have already been doomed
by bad code or changes in fashion. If both succeed, the forkers were right
enough about the management to survive the resistance to forking.  The most
interesting outcome is where the fork succeeds and the original project fails.
In this case we may be able to conclude that there really was a problem with
the old management that has been fixed by the fork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The X.org fork of XFree86 is particularly interesting because, after the fork,
XFree86 went into steep decline and died, to be fully replaced by X.org. There
may be interesting lessons we can learn from why the fork happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've set out the background in some detail because I think it is important to
be able to understand motivations and arguments of the actors in the fork
drama.  The royalist defenders of the status quo and the revolutionaries
behind the fork make the same kind of arguments that I have seen often and
recently.  Maybe seeing these arguments together with their outcome will help
make our own discussions easier to think about and better informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A sketch of early X history with some dramatis personae&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:wp-x-history"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:wp-x-history" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; attributes the original idea for X to Jim Gettys and Bob
Scheifler at MIT in 1984.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIT released version X10R3 under what later became known as the MIT license in
1986.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIT handed over stewardship to a newly formed MIT X consortium in 1988.  The
consortium hired Jim Fulton, Keith Packard in early 1988, with others joining
later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of XFree86 itself started as a fork. Thomas Roell developed
the first X implementation for the Intel 386 chip, called X386. He donated the
code to the X consortium and this code was part of the X11R5 release in 1991
(&lt;sup id="fnref:wp-x-history"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:wp-x-history" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:xfree86-history"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:xfree86-history" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).  Roell then took a job with a company
called SGCS and further versions of his X386 code were not open source
(&lt;sup id="fnref:rebel-code"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:rebel-code" rel="footnote"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:wp-x386"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:wp-x386" rel="footnote"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).  A group of programmers found they were maintaining
the original open-source version of X386 and joined together to form a fork of
X386 called "XFree86" (&lt;sup id="fnref:xfree86-announce"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:xfree86-announce" rel="footnote"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). XFree86 was a joke from the X386
name. The original team for XFree86 was David Dawes, Glenn Lai, Jim Tsillas
and David Wexelblat (&lt;sup id="fnref:xfree86-announce"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:xfree86-announce" rel="footnote"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get access to the development versions of the reference
X-consortium code, XFree86 needed to be a member of the X-consortium.  To do
this, XFree86 formed a corporation called "XFree86 inc" in January 1994.
XFree86 inc then asked for donations for X-consortium membership, and joined
(&lt;sup id="fnref:xfree86-history"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:xfree86-history" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least by May 1994, XFree86 had a BSD-like governance, with a core group and
a board of directors.  The board of directors was David Dawes, Glenn Lai, Dirk
Hohndel, Rich Murphey, Jon Tombs, Jim Tsillas, and David Wexelblat
(&lt;sup id="fnref:xfree-inc-minutes"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:xfree-inc-minutes" rel="footnote"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).  The core group was the same as or similar to the
board of directors at this stage (&lt;sup id="fnref:core-board-1994"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:core-board-1994" rel="footnote"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 1994 David Wexelblat handed over the XFree86 board presidency to
David Dawes (&lt;sup id="fnref:president-dawes"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:president-dawes" rel="footnote"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). Dawes continued as president at least until
2015 (&lt;sup id="fnref:current-bod"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:current-bod" rel="footnote"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1997, the X-consortium handed over X stewardship to a vendor group called
"The Open Group". In April 1998, the Open Group changed the X license to
require commercial entities to &lt;a href="http://old.lwn.net/lwn/1998/0409/xstate.html"&gt;pay a license
fee&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although [XFree86] may be able to claim several million users, the net
contribution to the development of the X Window System, as embodied by
specs, protocols or cash is a flat zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XFree86 decided to continue development without using any new code from the
Open Group reference implementation, in order to avoid the new license. At the
same time, the Open Group X development stalled (&lt;sup id="fnref:xfree86-history"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:xfree86-history" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) leaving
XFree86 to become the de-facto reference implementation.  The Open Group
reverted to the old license in September 1998, and formed a new consortium for
X stewardship called X.Org in 1999 (&lt;sup id="fnref:wp-x-history"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:wp-x-history" rel="footnote"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:xorg-consortium"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:xorg-consortium" rel="footnote"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). X.Org
(the consortium) went on to supervise the releases of the X reference
implementation.  XFree86 joined the X.Org consortium as an honorary member in
the same year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An article in 2001 said "Today, XFree86 is considered to be among the most
successful open source projects in existence." (&lt;sup id="fnref:xfree86-history"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:xfree86-history" rel="footnote"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1999 the board of directors was unchanged apart from the additions of Robin
Cutshaw and Marc Evans (&lt;sup id="fnref:readme-3.3.6"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:readme-3.3.6" rel="footnote"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By February 2003 the "core" group was 16 people, of which 7 were also on the
board of directors (at least as of 1999) (&lt;sup id="fnref:man-4.3.0"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:man-4.3.0" rel="footnote"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:coreteam"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:coreteam" rel="footnote"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we're ready for the events around the fork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background to the fork&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although XFree86 had a development CVS repository, it was only available to
those granted "membership" of the project.  The development mailing lists were
also not public (&lt;sup id="fnref:kp-lwn-interview"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:kp-lwn-interview" rel="footnote"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).  This had been forced on the project
because of the initial contract with the X consortium.  After the Open Group
had tried and failed to change the license, it appears that this was no longer
necessary, but nevertheless continued to be the case until Keith Packard
joined the project (&lt;sup id="fnref:kp-lwn-interview"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:kp-lwn-interview" rel="footnote"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Packard started to work on XFree86 at the end of 1999 as an employee of
SuSE. He became a member of the XFree86 core in the same year (&lt;sup id="fnref:coreteam"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:coreteam" rel="footnote"&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). He
moved to the Cambridge Research Laboratory to work for Compaq / HP at the end
of 2001 and continued to work on XFree86. Among his contributions were the
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Rendering_Extension"&gt;Render extension&lt;/a&gt;, (with
Jim Gettys) the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RandR"&gt;XRandR
extension&lt;/a&gt;(&lt;sup id="fnref:xrandr-man"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:xrandr-man" rel="footnote"&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), (with Carl
Worth) the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_(graphics)"&gt;Cairo rendering
library&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontconfig"&gt;fontconfig
library&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;sup id="fnref:kp-resume"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:kp-resume" rel="footnote"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packard successfully lobbied for open read access to the CVS repository, and
moving at least some of the development discussion to public mailing lists.
He said that some of the development discussion continued to be on private
mailing lists (&lt;sup id="fnref:kp-lwn-interview"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:kp-lwn-interview" rel="footnote"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a period of years before 2003 there seems have been considerable
frustration at the slow pace of XFree86 development, and the difficulty of
getting patches accepted.  Mike Harris was a Redhat developer working on
XFree86.  He complained in a blog post of very slow or completely failed patch
review, even from vendors like ATI, and the very small number of developers
with CVS write access given the size of the project (&lt;sup id="fnref:mh-blog"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:mh-blog" rel="footnote"&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).  In a
follow-up post he records his surprise at the level of support he had got for
his blog post by email (&lt;sup id="fnref:mh-blog-fu"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:mh-blog-fu" rel="footnote"&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).  A KDE developer agreed later that
there was a widespread impression of XFree86 as a slow and unresponsive
project (&lt;sup id="fnref:kp-issue"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:kp-issue" rel="footnote"&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). Others had similar complaints
(&lt;sup id="fnref:forum-communication"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:forum-communication" rel="footnote"&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:debian-xfree86-pain"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:debian-xfree86-pain" rel="footnote"&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packard felt that he had been gradually excluded from XFree86 management:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ability to contribute to the project was severely curtailed in stages,
first administration of the public server, next permission to represent
XFree86 to other groups, then administration of the public mailing lists, and
finally CVS access.  (&lt;sup id="fnref:kp-lwn-interview"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:kp-lwn-interview" rel="footnote"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lost CVS access when he committed the XFIXES extension to CVS in November
2002:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've stuck these features into a new XFIXES extension and included that in
XFree86 CVS so that others might see the code and specification and test
whether they solve the issues they're supposed to.  This does not represent
any endorsement by the XFree86 project or it's [sic] members (other than
me), nor any assurance that the extension will be included in future XFree86
releases.  (&lt;sup id="fnref:xfixes-announce"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:xfixes-announce" rel="footnote"&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension appears to have been disabled by default (&lt;sup id="fnref:xfixes-disabled"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:xfixes-disabled" rel="footnote"&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems the commit of XFIXES was just before a release feature freeze.  Some
process occurred by which Packard lost his CVS commit rights on the basis that
he should have discussed the changes before committing (&lt;sup id="fnref:kp-no-cvs"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:kp-no-cvs" rel="footnote"&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).  David
Dawes refers to a rumor that Packard did this in order to cause a crisis
(&lt;sup id="fnref:kp-xfixes-rumor"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:kp-xfixes-rumor" rel="footnote"&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).  There does not appear to be any public record of this
decision at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The forking fighting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2003, David Dawes used an email asking for public discussion of
XFree86 to announce that the XFree86 board of directors had expelled Keith
Packard from the core group (&lt;sup id="fnref:kp-is-out"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:kp-is-out" rel="footnote"&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been brought to the attention of the XFree86 Core Team that one of
its members, Keith Packard, has been actively (but privately) se)eking out
support for a fork of XFree86 that would be led by himself.  He is also in
the process of forming a by-invitation-only group of vested interests to
discuss privately concerns he has about XFree86 and the future of X.  He has
consistently refused to even disclose these concerns within the context of
the XFree86 Core Team, which makes his membership of that team unviable.  As
a consequence, Keith Packard is no longer a member of the XFree86 Core Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board claimed to have email evidence of Packard's intentions, but that
they were unable to release this evidence because the emails were private and
Packard had asked for them not to be released (&lt;sup id="fnref:dw-have-cause"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dw-have-cause" rel="footnote"&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). Packard
responded with permission to release the mails (&lt;sup id="fnref:kp-release-emails"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:kp-release-emails" rel="footnote"&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) and David
Wexelblat, for the board, said that they would release some version of the
emails soon after (&lt;sup id="fnref:dw-well-try"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dw-well-try" rel="footnote"&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).  I could find no evidence that this
happened. It's possible that the email enclosed in (&lt;sup id="fnref:private-cced"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:private-cced" rel="footnote"&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) is an
example of the discussion leading to Packard's expulsion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packard didn't reply directly to the thread expelling him from the core, but
instead posted an appeal for open governance of XFree86 (&lt;sup id="fnref:call-for-open"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:call-for-open" rel="footnote"&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).  He
lists four problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited development resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slow release schedules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of cooperation with other projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opacity of development processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packard thought that this was a problem of governance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the XFree86 Board of Directors is nominally in charge of XFree86, they
have absented themselves from governing the project and left that to the
XFree86 Core Team. The community is left wondering who is actually in charge
of XFree86. As a result, community trust in XFree86 leadership has suffered.
Decisions appear to be arbitrary and are not seen to reflect the will of the
community. The leadership has no accountability to the community: thus
community members have no ability to change project direction and the Board
has little incentive to do so.  In addition, the lack of clear formal
policies has made it difficult to resolve disputes when the usual consensus
breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He appealed to the board of directors for a change in governance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to move from our current position to one of community
control, but for XFree86 to make the transition, the current Board of
Directors must have a desire to do so. I encourage the X community to
support a community government for X development and hope the XFree86 Board
will adopt this model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subsequent discussion was often bad-tempered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An early reply by Alan Hourihane blamed 'limited development resources' on the
difficulty of the codebase, and emphasized the previous work of David Dawes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the rest of the above. I'd urge people to think of how XFree86 has
got were it has - under the directive of the current team, headed by David
Dawes. David has worked tirelessly in his own time to bring XFree86 where it
is today. And I applaud him for that devotion. (&lt;sup id="fnref:hourihane1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:hourihane1" rel="footnote"&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Dawes' employer, the CEO of Tungsten graphics (&lt;sup id="fnref:dawes-tungsten"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dawes-tungsten" rel="footnote"&gt;36&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) saw
problems in the organization of XFree86:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are seeing Keith Packard, a loyal and dedicated XFree86 contributor,
publicly express his frustration with an organization in which he has more
personal control than the vast majority of other people whose livelihood
depends on XFree86's continued success.  David Dawes has turned to that
constituency to assist him in resolving this situation.  Both of these
actions imply there is an organizational problem within XFree86 itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked for greater democracy in governing the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best organizational model I know of that adequately addresses both the
need to have managers who are the most knowledgeable and willing to work,
and the need to have a mechanism for all interested parties to voice their
concerns, is a representative democracy.  XFree86 has historically resisted
that model.  The increasing ubiquity of XFree86 has widened the discrepancy
between the desires of its constituency and those of its managing cadre.
Under those circumstances, a fork was inevitable.  There is currently no way
for dissenting voices to have an opportunity to fairly affect the direction
of XFree86, no matter what percentage of interested parties agree.
(&lt;sup id="fnref:tungsten-boss"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:tungsten-boss" rel="footnote"&gt;35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reply, David Wexelblat denied there were organizational problems, blaming
Packard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I'm not convinced that's true. The organizational problem was Keith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are PROCESS problems, but I don't accept (at face value) that there
are organizational problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wexelblat was clearly angry with Packard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what Keith is doing, at least how he's handled it, is just flat out
wrong. It's literally dishonest, and morally repugnant. Doesn't mean that
there aren't some valid issues to work, or that there is no need for
branching, but (a) it remains to be proven, and (b) I'll be damned if I'll
quietly accept it being done by someone who is lying to my face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and didn't see a need for fully open governance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are things that don't need to change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no reason for XFree86 BOD matters to be public. The XFree86
  Project, Inc is a privately-held corporation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no reason for Core Team matters to be public. This is the
  leadership forum, not a public forum. (&lt;sup id="fnref:dx-cheap"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dx-cheap" rel="footnote"&gt;37&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Dawes saw his opponents as trying to take over the hard work of others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of those really old X guys (pre XFree86) left X for dead in the early
'90s.  Now that they've seen that their attitudes then were short-sighted,
they want to come back and take over where they left off.  If we'd listened
to them, we'd have abandoned it too.  And they want us all to follow their
lead now? "Thanks for keeping it alive guys, but we'll take it from here,"
is the attitude. (&lt;sup id="fnref:dawes-old-guys"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dawes-old-guys" rel="footnote"&gt;38&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich Murphey could not see the point of governance discussions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You seem to have an obsession with governing, leading,
the will of the community and democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why are any of these critical to development success?  They
have nothing to do with what motivates open-source developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of direction for the core group was an advantage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core has very much to do, and as all-volunteer developers they pretty much
decide whatever they do themselves.  There is a remarkable degree of
consensus, in part because there is no one imposing a direction or mandate
on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers are leaders and should not be accountable to any 'community':&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developers are the leaders.  And yes, they have no
accountability to you because they are volunteers.  They
code whatever they damn well please when the want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish you luck in holding everyone accountable to the
will of the community and imposing formal policies on everyone.
I can imagine how many developers that will attract (&lt;sup id="fnref:murphey-phoey"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:murphey-phoey" rel="footnote"&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Cox"&gt;Alan Cox&lt;/a&gt; thought the problem was one
of resistance to change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isnt about voting, governance and dictatorship IMHO, its about change.
XFree86 is hard to get involved with usefully, resistant to cool ideas and
strongly wedded to an occasional not rolling regular release model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He insisted that change was essential to the project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X has to evolve, X has to do cool stuff, X has to let people break stuff, X
has to delegate trust to driver maintainers far more. To me it doesn't
matter if Keith and friends spin off an "Xperimental" or XFree itself
changes, but that change is vital to the future of X11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the XFree BOD doesn't want to be the evolving at high rate and really
believes the current plodding progress is the right path, don't harass Keith
work with him, endorse an Xperimental project and see what it produces.  If
it works the community wins, if it fails you get both to smirk, and to take
the good bits and the lessons it learned.  (&lt;sup id="fnref:cox-change"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:cox-change" rel="footnote"&gt;40&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packard and other interested developers held a series of teleconferences in
late March / early April to discuss what to do next
(&lt;sup id="fnref:teleconference-1"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:teleconference-1" rel="footnote"&gt;41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:teleconference-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:teleconference-2" rel="footnote"&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id="fnref:teleconference-3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:teleconference-3" rel="footnote"&gt;43&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). They decided to
set up a new site for collaboration on X windows work,
&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030531183127/http://xwin.org/"&gt;xwin.org&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xwin.org is a forum for community participation in X, not a development
project. The X development community needs to work together to form a
government. The hope is that community governance will encourage rapid
advances in the X window system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packard explained his reasons for acting in a Linux Weekly News interview
(&lt;sup id="fnref:kp-lwn-interview"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:kp-lwn-interview" rel="footnote"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highest priority should be to create an environment where people are
encouraged to participate to whatever extent they are able, and where these
contributors feel ownership of their code and pride in the community in
which they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Xouvert fork&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August
&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030819010029/http://www.xouvert.org/"&gt;xouvert.org&lt;/a&gt;
announced a fork of the XFree86 project. Xouvert did a first release in
December 2003, but the main XFree96 developers were not involved, and the
project slowed and folded relatively quickly thereafter (&lt;sup id="fnref:osnews-x-marks"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:osnews-x-marks" rel="footnote"&gt;44&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cygwin loses patience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2003, Cygwin publicly announced it would no longer contribute to
XFree86 development because they had been unable to persuade David Dawes to
give them CVS commit access (&lt;sup id="fnref:cygwin-no-more"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:cygwin-no-more" rel="footnote"&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Egbert Eich commented as an XFree86 core member:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that the level of frustration among contributors has risen to a
point that people are starting to use bad words.  I've tried to get support
from individual core team members for giving you commit rights. After I was
unable to do so (maybe I asked the wrong ones) I decided to no longer persue
[sic] the issue.  None of the initiatives I've made so far have been
accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't understand why people cannot deal with issues on the pragmatic level
by looking at how one can best distribute the workload so that the burdeon
[sic] on each individual volunteer is reduced.  The discussion always turns
to who owes what to whom. This is the wrong question. All or most of us are
volunteers. Therefore noone owes anything to anybody (&lt;sup id="fnref:egbert-sigh"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:egbert-sigh" rel="footnote"&gt;46&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;XFree86 core team disbands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Dawes successfully proposed disbanding the XFree86 core team in December
2003:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm very pleased to announce that a majority of the XFree86 core team has
voted in favour of my proposal to disband the core team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that this is an acknowlegement [sic] that the core team was no
longer representative of the active, experienced and skilled XFree86
developers, or a place where technical discussion happens (&lt;sup id="fnref:core-disbands"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:core-disbands" rel="footnote"&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bare announcement caused considerable confusion, with some taking it to
mean that the XFree86 project was closing down (&lt;sup id="fnref:disband-confused"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:disband-confused" rel="footnote"&gt;48&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). There
was no indication of any other structure to replace the core.  An ex-member of
the core team explained it as a way of avoiding potential complaint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it doesn't really mean anything at all, so it's hard to say much
about it.  The core team was basically an honor role, which outsiders
assumed was a kabal [sic] of some sort despite the core and bod [board of
directors] repeatedly explaining that it wasn't.  Now it's gone, so people
will have to find something else to complain about. (&lt;sup id="fnref:core-gone"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:core-gone" rel="footnote"&gt;49&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Start of the X.org foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Januay 2004, many of those involved in the discussion formed a new company
called the X.Org foundation (as distinct from the previous X.Org consortium).
A presentation to the Linux World Expo (&lt;sup id="fnref:xorg-foundation"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:xorg-foundation" rel="footnote"&gt;50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) gave the mission
statement as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To promote a proactive and participatory community for Open Source X Window
System and desktop development&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same presentation records that a development tree had been established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interim board of directors (&lt;sup id="fnref:xorg-interim-bod"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:xorg-interim-bod" rel="footnote"&gt;51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) was composed of
representatives from industry and free software organizations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuart Anderson, Free Standards Group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Egbert Eich - SuSe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mattais Ettrich - KDE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jim Gettys - Hewlett Packard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Georg Greve - FSF Europe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuart Kreitman - SUN Microsystems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kevin Martin - Red Hat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jim McQuillan - Linux Terminal Server Project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leon Shiman - Shiman Associates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeremy White - Code Weavers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;License change and collapse of XFree86&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of January 2004, David Dawes announced a change to the base XFree86
license (&lt;sup id="fnref:license-announce"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:license-announce" rel="footnote"&gt;53&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.xfree86.org/legal/licenses.html"&gt;new license&lt;/a&gt; added a
non-standard clause that required any derived work to include a
specified acknowledgment of XFree86 in the documentation or "in the software
itself":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end-user documentation included with the redistribution, if any, must
include the following acknowledgment: "This product includes software
developed by The XFree86 Project, Inc (http://www.xfree86.org/) and its
contributors", in the same place and form as other third-party
acknowledgments. Alternately, this acknowledgment may appear in the software
itself, in the same form and location as other such third-party
acknowledgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It later turned out that the board of directors had unanimously agreed to this
change in a private meeting (&lt;sup id="fnref:dawes-hung-out"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dawes-hung-out" rel="footnote"&gt;56&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people considered that the new license did not allow derived code to use
the GPL license, because the GPL says that a GPL or derived work "may not
impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein." (&lt;sup id="fnref:gpl-2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:gpl-2" rel="footnote"&gt;52&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).  Here the further restriction is the requirement
to acknowledge XFree86 in documentation or "in the software itself".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawes appeared unmoved by concerns about this change, suggesting that the GPL
ought to change instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has anyone considered modifying the GPL to be more compatible with other
Open Source licences rather than trying to force all Open Source licences to
be a subset of the GPL? (&lt;sup id="fnref:gpl-should-change"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:gpl-should-change" rel="footnote"&gt;54&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long email threads that followed were mostly against the license change
- e.g. (&lt;sup id="fnref:gettys-on-change"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:gettys-on-change" rel="footnote"&gt;58&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;sup id="fnref:license-no-support"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:license-no-support" rel="footnote"&gt;55&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Stallman joined the discussion to see if he could help restore GPL
compatibility (&lt;sup id="fnref:stallman-on-license"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:stallman-on-license" rel="footnote"&gt;59&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) but Dawes was not ready to compromise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I also believe that all of that is irrelevant, and that anyone who
writes software should have the freedom to set conditions on what others may
do with it(*).  The choice for others is then either to accept the
conditions (legally enforcable or not), or to avoid said software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(*) Providing of course that the act of setting the conditions is not itself
illegal. (&lt;sup id="fnref:dawes-no-gpl"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dawes-no-gpl" rel="footnote"&gt;60&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawes was clearly surprised that others on the board did not support his
unmoving position on the license:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't speak for why the XFree86 board that voted unanimously for the
change, (and some of whom were advocating more radical changes), have hung
me out to dry on this.  I also can't speak for why some developers have
privately supported the change, but won't do so publicly.  But then taking
the heat on things like this comes with the job.  And I have very thick
asbestos undies, but boy do they itch :-) (&lt;sup id="fnref:dawes-hung-out"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:dawes-hung-out" rel="footnote"&gt;56&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;X.org releases fork of X&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2004, the new X.Org foundation released their own fork of X
Windows (&lt;sup id="fnref:xorg-release"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:xorg-release" rel="footnote"&gt;57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new X.Org release, called X Window System Version 11 Release 6.7
(X11R6.7), builds on the work of the X.Org X11R6.6 and XFree86TM Project
Inc. V4.4RC2 releases to combine many of the latest developments from a
large number of the participants and companies working with the X Window
community ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement quotes Jim Gettys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release marks the return to community development of the X Window
System under governance open to all contributors for the first time since
the founding of the X Consortium in 1988.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among other endorsements in that announcment, Branden Robinson of Debian
writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're also delighted that the X.Org Foundation is dedicated to retaining the
licensing model that has made the X Window System an enduring success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The decline and fall of XFree86&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The license change appears to have been the last straw in forcing adoption of
X.org instead of XFree86 (&lt;sup id="fnref:xfree86-and-gpl"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:xfree86-and-gpl" rel="footnote"&gt;61&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).  In a page dated from May 2004,
XFree86 lists the Linux and BSD distributions supporting the first release of
XFree86 that contained the license change (&lt;sup id="fnref:xfree-distributions"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:xfree-distributions" rel="footnote"&gt;62&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).  The list
does not include SUSE, Redhat or Debian among many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page at (&lt;sup id="fnref:xfree86-and-gpl"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:xfree86-and-gpl" rel="footnote"&gt;61&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) gives a vivid summary of the almost complete
collapse of XFree86 at this point, with all significant developer and packager
interest switching to X.org.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://julipedia.meroh.net/2013/06/self-interview-after-leaving-netbsd.html"&gt;Self-interview after leaving the NetBSD
board&lt;/a&gt; by Julio Merino.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lead me to an earlier &lt;a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-users/2006/08/30/0016.html"&gt;NetBSD resignation
email&lt;/a&gt; from
Charles Hannum, one of the "4 originators of NetBSD".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They both complain of lack of leadership.  From Merino's post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[the "core" and "board of directors"] teams are dysfunctional because they
do not provide leadership: all they do is act reactively to requests from
users and/or to resolve internal disputes. In other words: there is no
initiative nor vision emerging from these teams (and, for that matter, from
anybody).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Hannum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no high-level direction; if you ask "what about the problems with
threads" or "will there be a flash-friendly file system", the best you'll
get is "we'd love to have both" -- but no work is done to recruit people to
code these things, or encourage existing developers to work on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merino also complains that the NetBSD leadership will not take risks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As things are today, the project leaders will almost always settle for
either the conservative solution or a solution that compromises on every
detail so as to not annoy anyone. Unfortunately, this approach implicitly
disappoints a group of people — a group of people that may not be vocal
enough to express their preferences out of previous disappointments. All of
this, of course, only happens when the leader teams are asked about
something, as they will rarely provide input unless asked for (see reactive
model above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannum wonders aloud whether the diffuse management structure is the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of this early structure (CVS, web site, cabal ["core" group], etc.) was
copied verbatim by other open source (this term not being in wide use yet)
projects -- even the form of the project name and the term "core".  This
later became a kind of standard template for starting up an open source
project. [...] I'm sorry to say that I helped create this problem, and that
most of the projects which modeled themselves after NetBSD (probably due to
its high popularity in 1993 and 1994) have suffered similar problems.
FreeBSD and XFree86, for example, have both forked successor projects
(Dragonfly and X.org) for very similar reasons.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hannum wanted a change in leadership:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) There must be a strong leadership, and it is not the current one.
 The leadership must honestly want NetBSD to be a premier, world class
 system with leading edge features.  The leadership must set
 aggressive goals, and actively recruit people to make them happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must repeat a point I've made earlier.  The current "management" of the
project is not going to either fix the project's problems, or lead the
project to solutions.  They are going to maintain the status quo, and
nothing else.  If the project is to rise from its charred stump, this
"management" must be disbanded and replaced wholesale.  Anything less is a
non-solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly before this, the minister of agriculture Yan Yi had been put to
death. Yan Yi had originally been a village head in Ji'nan.  Because of his
honesty and integrity, he was gradually promoted in office until he became
one of the highest ministers. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... Yan Yi was on bad terms with Zhang Tang.  When someone bought an
accusation against Yan Yi for some other affair, the matter was referred to
Zhang Tang for investigation.  Earlier Yan Yi had been talking with one of
his guests, when the guest remarked that some new law that had just been put
into affect did not seem very practical.  Yan Yi had made no answer, but
given only a subtle wry twist of his lips.  Zhang Tang sent a memorial to the
throne relating this affair and stating "Yang Yi, one of the nine highest
ministers, having seen that the law was impractical, did not state his
opinion to the emperor, but nevertheless disapproved of it in his heart.  For
this offence he is deserving of death!".  From this time on, the crime known
as "disapproval of heart" became a part of the law, and most of the high
ministers and officials resorted to gross flattery in order to stay in the
good graces of the emperor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the time of these men on, the empire was torn by the strife of the
warring kingdoms. Men honoured deceit and power and scoffed at benevolence
and righteousness; they put wealth and possession first and courtesy and
humility last.&lt;/p&gt;
