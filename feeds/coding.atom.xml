machine-learning library from Python (with C++ and CUDA) to Swift. The
justification has date “April 2018”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember thinking at the time that an important part of the
decision was that many of the engineers knew Swift. And that that
probably wasn’t going to be true for engineers outside that team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I found that Google has &lt;a
href="https://github.com/tensorflow/swift"&gt;already abandoned the Swift
TenrsorFlow project&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;a
href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3608151/swift-for-tensorflow-project-shuts-down.html"&gt;article
in InfoWorld&lt;/a&gt; dates the shutdown to around February 2021, and that is
also the date of the last commit to the Github repository linked above.
The &lt;a
href="https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/graphs/code-frequency"&gt;Github
code-frequency plot&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the project was more or less
dormant from April 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this interesting only because I was surprised that Google
would be quick to abandon a decision that they appear to have taken
carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe related, &lt;a
href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?tags=pytorch%2Ctensorflow"&gt;StackOverflow
trends&lt;/a&gt; shows Tensorflow discussion plateaued around the beginning of
2018, dropped in late 2019 and early 2020, and then started rising again
from mid-2021. Meanwhile the other standard machine-learning library, &lt;a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyTorch"&gt;PyTorch&lt;/a&gt;, has seen a
linear rise since its release in late 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
