(X:96)</a> by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Younger">Pliny the
Younger</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, around 112 CE, Pliny was the governor of a
Roman province in a region of modern-day Turkey. He is asking for advice
from the Roman Emperor <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan">Trajan</a> about how strict
he should be in punishing his subjects for being Christians:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is my custom, Sir, to refer to you in all cases where I do not
feel sure, for who can better direct my doubts or inform my ignorance? I
have never been present at any legal examination of the Christians, and
I do not know, therefore, what are the usual penalties passed upon them,
or the limits of those penalties, or how searching an inquiry should be
made. I have hesitated a great deal in considering whether any
distinctions should be drawn according to the ages of the accused;
whether the weak should be punished as severely as the more robust;
whether if they renounce their faith they should be pardoned, or whether
the man who has once been a Christian should gain nothing by recanting;
whether the name itself, even though otherwise innocent of crime, should
be punished, or only the crimes that gather round it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the quote makes clear, Pliny is not sure what the punishments for
Christians should be, but later in the letter, it seems that the death
penalty was a common option:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many persons of all ages, and of both sexes alike, are being brought
into peril of their lives by their accusers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One issue that he ran into, was that, on fairly careful
investigation, the activities of Christians seemed oddly benign:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Recanting Christians] declared that the sum of their guilt or their
error only amounted to this, that on a stated day they had been
accustomed to meet before daybreak and to recite a hymn among themselves
to Christ, as though he were a god, and that so far from binding
themselves by oath to commit any crime, their oath was to abstain from
theft, robbery, adultery, and from breach of faith, and not to deny
trust money placed in their keeping when called upon to deliver it. When
this ceremony was concluded, it had been their custom to depart and meet
again to take food, but it was of no special character and quite
harmless, and they had ceased this practice after the edict in which, in
accordance with your orders, I had forbidden all secret societies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He even went to the trouble of torturing a couple of female church
leaders, also with disappointing results:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought it the more necessary, therefore, to find out what truth
there was in these statements by submitting two women, who were called
deaconesses, to the torture, but I found nothing but a debased
superstition carried to great lengths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, he does note that his measures against the Christians
have been successful in the improvement of society:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the contagion of this superstition has spread not only through
the free cities, but into the villages and the rural districts, and yet
it seems to me that it can be checked and set right. It is beyond doubt
that the temples, which have been almost deserted, are beginning again
to be thronged with worshippers, that the sacred rites which have for a
long time been allowed to lapse are now being renewed, and that the food
for the sacrificial victims is once more finding a sale, whereas, up to
recently, a buyer was hardly to be found. From this it is easy to infer
what vast numbers of people might be reclaimed, if only they were given
an opportunity of repentance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.attalus.org/old/pliny10b.html#97">Trajan’s
reply</a> is model of managerial wisdom and restraint. The Christians
should be punished, but only if they refuse to recant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have adopted the proper course, my dear Pliny … The Christians
are not to be hunted out; if they are brought before you and the offence
is proved, they are to be punished, but with this reservation - that if
any one denies that he is a Christian and makes it clear that he is not,
by offering prayers to our deities, then he is to be pardoned because of
his recantation, however suspicious his past conduct may have been.</p>
</blockquote>
