<section id="software-expert-build-or-practitioner-build"
class="level2">
<h2>Software expert build or practitioner build?</h2>
<p>I can think of two simple models:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Software expert build - or “Here, try this thing I built.” The
developer has an idea for a library that they believe will be useful for
people doing data analysis. They build it, and then go to find
users.</li>
<li>Practitioner build - or “I need this thing, so I’m going to build
it.” The developer has some data they need to analyze, or other work
they need to do, or do more efficiently. They build the library to do
that work.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, a entirely new language is likely to be in the Software
Expert Build category, because a working scientist or data analyst is
unlikely to have the time or expertise to build a language. I presume
that domain-specific libraries, like <a
href="https://www.astropy.org">Astropy</a>, will usually come from the
“Practitioner Build” group, where development gives more immediate
benefit for work.</p>
<p>To put the distinction another way - what matters in open-source
development: having a hard data analysis problem; or being expert in
software development; or do we need both (to get started)?</p>
</section>
<section id="some-references-that-came-to-mind" class="level2">
<h2>Some references that came to mind</h2>
<p>The “Practitioner Build” model follows Eric Raymond’s first lesson
from <a
href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s02.html">The
Cathedral and the Bazaar</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer’s
personal itch.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Our question is - what happens if the person with the itch is not
(yet) a developer. Does that person need a developer to come and help?
Or do they teach themselves, and become a developer?</p>
<p>There is some discussion of this problem in the paper <a
href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~hollings/papers/ieee-sw-2008.pdf">Understanding
the High-Performance Computing Community: A Software Engineer’s
Perspective</a>. The paper describes the results of interaction between
software engineers and scientists using large clusters to simulate
“physical phenomena such as earthquakes, global climate change or
nuclear reactions”. The message I took from the paper was that Software
Experts often suggest solutions that Practitioners will not use, often
with good reason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our aim in this paper is to distill our experience about how software
engineers can productively engage the HPC community. Several software
engineering practices generally considered good ideas in other
development environments are quite mismatched to the needs of the HPC
community. We found that keys to successful interactions include a
healthy sense of humility on the part of software engineering
researchers and the avoidance of assumptions that software engineering
expertise applies equally in all contexts.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="why-it-matters" class="level2">
<h2>Why it matters</h2>
<p>The distinction between Software Expert Build and Practitioner Build
is important, because the models have different implications for funding
and support. If the most fruitful development comes from Software Expert
Build, then we can follow a traditional path by finding and funding
experts with good ideas. If Practitioner Build has been more effective,
we will need more imagination, because the practitioner builders will be
harder to find, before most of the work is done.</p>
</section>
<section id="relevant-data-from-scientific-python-libraries"
class="level2">
<h2>Relevant data from scientific Python libraries</h2>
<p>This post is to collate some data on the distinction between Software
Expert Build and Practitioner Build, for the three most fundamental
libraries in scientific Python: Numpy; Scipy and Matplotlib. Numpy is
the base layer that implements the array object in Python, and seems
close to a language on the spectrum above. Scipy is a collection of
libraries that build on Numpy, and is therefore closer to the domain
libraries. Matplotlib is the standard 2D plotting library for
Python.</p>
<p>I have also done some more superficial analysis of another three
important projects in the scientific Python world: IPython / Jupyter
(interactive prompt / Notebook interface); Pandas (base library for data
science); and Statsmodels (statistical models).</p>
<p>I have two sources of data to look at the Software Expert /
Practitioner build distinction. The first are brief early histories of
each project, from the main authors. Was the project driven by a good
idea, in search of work to do, or was it driven by work that needed
doing? I have histories for all the projects above.</p>
<p>The second source of data is the educational background of the
contributors. In the case of Software Expert Build, I expect
contributors to have training in computer science in general, and
algorithm design / software engineering in particular. I have these data
for Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib. I didn’t have time to research the
backgrounds of the developers for the other libraries.</p>

<h2>Numpy</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Hugunin">Jim Hugunin</a>
was a major author of <em>Numeric</em>, the package that later became
Numpy. He summarizes the origins of Numeric in <a
href="http://hugunin.net/story_of_jython.html">the story of
Jython</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The story of Jython begins with the pain of finishing my master’s
thesis at MIT. In that thesis I fabricated, measured, and analyzed
superconductor-semiconductor junctions as a potential building block for
a quantum computer. For analyzing the measurements and comparing them
with theory (the Bogoliubov-deGennes equations) I used matlab
extensively. Matlab is a wonderful language for a wide range numerical
analyses; however, it is a terrible language in which to do anything
else. In order to overcome its shortcomings, I eventually cobbled
together a hodge-podge of C, Python and matlab code to produce my final
results.</p>
<p>I knew there had to be a better way of doing this. After finishing my
thesis, I started to work on an extension to Python to support numeric
analysis as naturally as matlab does, without sacrificing any of the
power of Python as a rich general-purpose programming language. This was
the first project where I discovered the power of a collaborative open
source community. The contributions of Jim Fulton, David Ascher, Paul
DuBois, Konrad Hinsen, and many others made that project much more
successful than it could ever have been as an isolated endeavor. …</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a
href="https://legacy.python.org/workshops/1995-12/papers/hugunin.html">Elsewhere</a>
Hugunin notes that Numeric “is based on Jim Fulton’s original
implementation of a matrix object as a container class.” He links to the

Fulton’s “Fortran Matrix extension”.</p>

<p>Although Hugunin was studying Electrical Engineering and Computer
Science when he was writing Numeric, his description above gives the
impression of an engineer building a machine that happened to be a
computer, where the analysis problems arose from the task.</p>
<p>Fulton <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> has a background in civil and
systems engineering. At the time Numeric was starting, he was working at
the US Geological Survey. He records his roles as “Data analysis,
hydrologic modeling, and development and support of data analysis
tools.”, so this qualifies him as a practitioner. He was also studying
for an MS in software systems engineering, making him a rare case of a
trained practitioner and formally trained software engineer.</p>

<p>From the table above, contributors with specific education in
computer science are Travis Oliphant (bachelor’s and master’s degrees
are in Electrical and Computer Engineering), David Cournapeau (PhD in
Informatics), and Mark Wiebe (bachelor’s in computer science and
math).</p>
<p>Oliphant’s master’s thesis was applied work on “New Methods for
Scatterometry based Wind Estimation”. <a
href="http://hdl.handle.net/2433/126467">Cournapeau’s thesis</a> was
also applied work on speech processing and machine learning. I think
both are examples of practitioners who became developers in response to
the needs of their analysis.</p>
<p>Mark Wiebe had a lot of experience in software engineering before he
began to work on Numpy (see <a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>). His is an
interesting case, in that he made substantial contributions to Numpy,
including the widely used <code>einsum</code> function, but he is also
the only contributor that I can remember who had a <a
href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/297">large amount of their
code pulled out of the main Numpy repository</a> because the community
could not agree on the changes.</p>

<h2>Scipy</h2>
<p>From the “Origins of Numpy” chapter in <a
href="http://web.mit.edu/dvp/Public/numpybook.pdf">Guide to Numpy</a> by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Oliphant">Travis
Oliphant</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1998, as a graduate student studying biomedical imaging at the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, I came across Python and its numerical
extension (Numeric) while I was looking for ways to analyze large data
sets for Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Ultrasound using a high-level
language. …</p>
<p>As I progressed with my thesis work, programming in Python was so
enjoyable that I felt inhibited when I worked with other programming
frameworks. As a result, when a task I needed to perform was not
available in the core language, or in the Numeric extension, I looked
around and found C or Fortran code that performed the needed task,
wrapped it into Python (either by hand or using SWIG), and used the new
functionality in my programs.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>By operating in this need-it-make-it fashion I ended up with a
substantial library of extension modules that helped Python + Numeric
become easier to use in a scientific setting. …</p>
<p>When I finished my Ph.D. in 2001, Eric Jones (who had recently
completed his Ph.D. at Duke) contacted me because he had a collection of
Python modules he had developed as part of his thesis work as well. He
wanted to combine his modules with mine into one super package. Together
with Pearu Peterson we joined our efforts, and SciPy was born in
2001.</p>

<p>Scipy top contributors with computer science training are Oliphant,
Cournapeau, Weckesser and Bell. I have already discussed Oliphant and
Cournapeau above; I think both are best described as practitioners who
became developers. Weckesser has a Bachelor’s and a Master’s in Computer
and System Engineering; his publication list <a href="#fn28"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
suggests he has a longstanding interest in numerical software. <a
href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=BA-ae2MAAAAJ">Bell’s
Google Scholar page</a> shows he has many papers at the interface of
software and numerical methods. I think both Weckesser and Bell can
reasonably be classified as Software Experts who are also Practitioners
(of numerical methods).</p>

<h2>Matplotlib</h2>
<p>From <a href="https://matplotlib.org/users/history.html">history of
Matplotlib</a> by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Hunter">John Hunter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For years, I used to use MATLAB exclusively for data analysis and
visualization. MATLAB excels at making nice looking plots easy. When I
began working with EEG data, I found that I needed to write applications
to interact with my data, and developed an EEG analysis application in
MATLAB. As the application grew in complexity, interacting with
databases, http servers, manipulating complex data structures, I began
to strain against the limitations of MATLAB as a programming language,
and decided to start over in Python. Python more than makes up for all
of MATLAB’s deficiencies as a programming language, but I was having
difficulty finding a 2D plotting package …</p>
<p>Finding no package that suited me just right, I did what any
self-respecting Python programmer would do: rolled up my sleeves and
dived in. …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Hunter is also one of the top 10 contributors to Matplotlib by

<h2>Pandas</h2>
<p>Pandas is the fundamental library for most data science tasks.</p>
<p>I have not analyzed the top contributors. Here is a short early
history.</p>
<p>Wes McKinney created Pandas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I studied theoretical mathematics at MIT (graduating in late 2006)
…</p>
<p>From August 2007 to July 2010, I worked on the front office quant
research team at AQR Capital Management … I started building pandas on
April 6, 2008, as part of a skunkworks effort to reproduce some
econometric research in Python. (from <a
href="https://wesmckinney.com/pages/about.html">McKinney’s blog
bio</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He gives more detail in a <a
href="https://www.pythonpodcast.com/wes-mckinney-python-for-data-analysis-episode-203">podcast</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a mathematics background and I didn’t do a lot of programming
in the past. …. I really didn’t start programming until much later in
life because I realized at some point that I needed to program in order
to be useful. In my first job in AQR capital management … I was struck
by how difficult it was to go about very basic data analysis problems. …
it felt that there was a disconnect between ability of your mind and
your brain to think about what you want do with the data and the actual
tools to do what you want. … I got really interested in building tools
for myself to be more productive.</p>

<section id="ipython-jupyter" class="level2">
<h2>IPython / Jupyter</h2>
<p><a href="http://fperez.org/personal.html">Fernando Pérez</a> created
IPython in 2001. IPython gradually developed into Jupyter, the widely
used interactive notebook.</p>
<p>From the website above, Fernando gives his biography as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was born in Medellín, Colombia, where I did my undergraduate
studies in Physics at the Universidad de Antioquia. From there I moved
to Boulder, Colorado, where I completed my PhD in particle physics,
before spending a few years as a post-doc in Applied Mathematics. In
2008 I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, where I now work at UC
Berkeley, on research involving algorithms and tool development in
neuroimaging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He is now a professor of statistics at UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>Fernando wrote a <a
href="http://blog.fperez.org/2012/01/ipython-notebook-historical.html">history
of IPython and the Notebook</a>. The quotes in this section are from
that blog post, unless I list another source.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s go back to the beginning: when I started IPython in late 2001,
I was a graduate student in physics at CU Boulder. … … the natural flow
of scientific computing pretty much mandates a solid interactive
environment, so while other Python users and developers may like having
occasional access to interactive facilities, scientists more or less
demand them. … We continued slowly working on IPython, … By that point
Brian Granger and Min Ragan-Kelley had come on board.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a
href="https://us.pycon.org/2017/speaker/profile/2091">Ragan-Kelley</a>
has a “PhD in Applied Science &amp; Technology, with an emphasis in
computational plasma physics”. <a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-granger-b9998662">Granger</a>
has a bachelor’s in Engineering Physics, and PhD in Physics. At the time
he joined IPython, in <a
href="https://ipython.org/_static/sloangrant/sloan-grant.html">2004</a>,
he was an assistant professor in Physics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is where early 2010 found us … I read an article about [the
messaging library] ZeroMQ … It became clear that we had the right tools
to build a two-process implementation of IPython that could give us the
‘real IPython’ but communicating with a different frontend, and this is
precisely what we wanted for cleaner parallel computing, multiprocess
clients and a notebook. … In October 2010 James Gao (a Berkeley
neuroscience graduate student) wrote up a quick prototype of a web
notebook, demonstrating again that this design really worked well and
could be easily used by a completely different client. … And finally, in
the summer of 2011 Brian took James’ prototype and built up a fully
working system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://ipython.org/_static/sloangrant/sloan-grant.html">A
2012 grant application</a> describes the process by which Pérez, Granger
and Kelley trained themselves as developers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While we were all trained as physicists without any software
engineering education, in our interaction with the world of open source
developers we have learned and adopted rigorous software engineering
practices that we follow to ensure IPython remains a robust and
high-quality project even as it grows.</p>

<h2>Statsmodels</h2>
<p>These are notes for the early history of the Statmodels project.</p>
<p>Skipper Seabold <a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> started Statsmodels proper, as a <a
href="https://scipystats.blogspot.com/2009/04/getting-started-with-gsoc-and-scipy.html">Google
Summer of Code project</a>, in collaboration with Josef Perktold <a
href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/credibility-crisis-in-data-science">Seabold
was interviewed in a recent podcast</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My background, my major up until my last year of undergrad was poetry
writing. So I could not have been further from math and data science and
programming. I switched over to studying economics. Ended up going to
grad school for econ. Really liked econometrics, anyway, we got into our
math econ kind of boot camp and first math econ class and it was taught
in Python. … It really helped solidify the stuff I was working on. I
felt like I didn’t really understand it until I could code it. And once
I could code it I was like, “Oh sure I totally understand this and now
can program and speak confidently about it I guess.” … I jumped in, and
the thing that was really helpful was there was a problem out there that
I needed to solve. I needed to be able to run an OLS regression, get the
results out of the regression in a way that was easily understandable,
build a user interface. I didn’t know the first thing about programming,
but I had some good and patient mentors and kind of co-developers along
the way. I learned a ton from the open source community. Just by kind
of, honestly, failing in public, flailing in public, making pull
requests and having people take the time out of their day to spend hours
reading your code and suggest how to be a better programmer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the <a
href="https://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2010/pdfs/seabold.pdf">Statsmodels
Scipy conference paper</a> by Seabold and Perktold:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… statsmodels was started by Jonathan Taylor, a statistician now at
Stanford, as part of SciPy under the name <em>models</em>. Eventually,
<em>models</em> was removed from SciPy and became part of the NIPY
neuroimaging project in order to mature. Improving the models code was
later accepted as a SciPy-focused project for the Google Summer of Code
2009 and again in 2010. It is currently distributed as a SciKit, or
add-on package for SciPy. The current main developers of statsmodels are
trained as economists with a background in econometrics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taylor wrote the original code to implement analysis of brain imaging
data.</p>
<p>Perktold <a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> is an economist. He has a PhD in
economics.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In very brief summary, the histories of the various projects here are
striking in the clarity with which they describe the process where
practitioners start with an analysis problem, then build the solution. I
would say they give very strong evidence for the Practitioner Build
model.</p>
<p>The analysis of contributor backgrounds is a little more ambiguous.
There are some major contributors, particularly in Scipy, that do have a
strong prior background in software engineering. The large majority of
top contributors, and project founders, did not have this background. A
background in physical sciences is common, but there are many
contributors with a math background.</p>
<p>Overall, these data give strong preference for the Practitioner
Builder model. Unless something has changed, we have a difficult
problem, in trying to support the practitioners who will build the next
generation of libraries. If these histories are still typical, by the
time we find them, most of the work will have been done.</p>
