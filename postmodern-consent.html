            <p><strong>Warning : this page refers in a general way to a legal case
involving sex with children. Though the facts are ugly, I believed it
important to document some reactions to the case, as insight into the
world-view of some influential thinkers in 1970s France.</strong></p>
<p>As a preface, consider the <a
href="https://asterisk.dynevor.org/wicked-and-dangerous-fraud.html">“irresponsibility …
of the liberal community”</a> that James Baldwin complained of during
the McCarthy hearings. Now …</p>
<p>The Versailles Affair was a French legal case from 1977 in which
three men <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_petition_against_age_of_consent_laws">aged
39 to 45</a>, were prosecuted for having sex with male and female
children aged 13 and 14. Many important intellectuals, including the
founders of post-modernism, publicly supported the immediate release of
these men for time served, and repeal or revision of the law that
allowed prosecution of adults for sex with consenting children.</p>
<p>I am trying to be as fair as possible to the original sources, by
quoting them at length, with minimal elision, and in context. I’m happy
to hear any suggestions of ways I could do better at that.</p>
<p>This is a translation <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> from the <a
href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affaire_de_Versailles">French
Wikipedia page on the Versailles Affair</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="the-case">The case</h1>
<p>Bernard Dejager, Jean-Claude Gallien and Jean Burckhardt were
arrested on October 20, 1973 for having had sexual intercourse with
girls and boys aged 13 and 14. The circumstances were sufficiently
unclear that the investigation lasted more than three years and two
months. The acts allegedly took place at the Camping Club de France de
Meudon, the oldest specialized camping club in France, located in the
Forest of Meudon, which has various groups, including a naturist
group.</p>
<p>The three men appeared before the Assize Court of Versailles for
“indecent assault without violence on minors aged 15”, which, at the
time, qualified as a crime. Over the course of investigation it seemed
that they were at risk of five to ten years in prison.</p>
<h1
id="matzneffs-op-ed-then-the-petition-of-support-for-the-accused.">Matzneff’s
op-ed, then the petition of support for the accused.</h1>
<p>On November 8, 1976, in the newspaper Le Monde, the writer Gabriel
Matzneff published an op-ed in support of the accused, titled “Is love a
crime?, in which he complains bitterly about the lack of support he
received after his appearance on”Apostrophes”, Bernard Pivot’s new TV
show, on September 12, 1975, for which had been severely criticized. He
had received a complaint from a viewer who believed that this
justification for pedophilia had harmed his family.</p>
<p>Two and a half months later, the three defendants elicited a petition
of support that emphasized the fact that they had been in preventive
detention for three years and two months. The petition is signed by
various public figures: the text affirms that the children suffered “no
violence”, and that they were “consenting”, adding furthermore: “if a
girl of thirteen is entitled to the pill, what is that for?”. The
petition asserts that the tenacity with which the three accused were
being prosecuted was disproportionate: “Three years in prison for
caresses and kisses, that is enough”. The petitioners, who include
well-known intellectuals, consider there is a clear disproportion
between the classification of “crime” that justifies such severity, and
the nature of the alleged offenses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several famous intellectuals were signatories, <a
href="https://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/index2.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lemonde.fr%2Farchives%2Farticle%2F1977%2F01%2F26%2Fa-propos-d-un-proces_2854399_1819218.html#federation=archive.wikiwix.com">such
as</a> Gilles Deleuze, Roland Barthes, Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul
Sartre and Félix Guattari.</p>
<p>Later, some of the same people signed a <a
href="https://www.dolto.fr/fd-code-penal-crp.html">petition to the
French parliament</a> that cites the case as an example of legal excess.
The petition calls for the law to be repealed or changed to make it
legal for children to have sex with adults or other children. Here I
have quoted the beginning and end of the petition:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1
id="open-letter-to-the-commission-for-the-revision-of-the-penal-code-supporting-the-revision-of-some-legislative-instruments-governing-the-relations-between-adults-and-minors">Open
letter to the Commission for the Revision of the Penal Code supporting
the revision of some legislative instruments governing the relations
between adults and minors</h1>
<p>Relationships between children, adolescents and adults are subject to
significant restrictions by law: by the notion of “corruption of minors”
(which can consist of a simple single overnight stay of a minor); by the
general ban on having sexual relations with children under the age of
15; or by the special ban that targets homosexual relations with minors
aged 15 to 18, defined as “immodest or against nature”.</p>
<p>The obsolescence of the notions underlying these crimes or
misdemeanors (“modesty”, “nature”), the evolution of mores in a youth
who feel the excesses of fastidious segregation as oppressive, mean that
these legal articles are no more than the instrument of coercion, in
place of a guaranteed right.</p>
<p>A recent case has just clearly shown the disproportion between the
criminal apparatus and the nature of the acts it punishes. After more
than three years of preventive detention, three people accused of
“indecent assault committed or attempted without violence on the person
of children of either sex aged under 15”, acts that the law (article 331
§1 of the Penal Code) qualifies as “crimes”, were sentenced by the Court
of Assizes of Yvelines to 5 years in prison, suspended.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The signatories of this letter … believe, more generally, that the
provisions claiming to “protect” children and young people, such as
article 334-1 concerning “the incitement of minors to debauchery”, which
make it possible to charge anyone who “promotes” or “facilitates” sexual
relations between minors, or article 356 concerning the “abuse of
minors”, are, like article 331, increasingly incompatible with the
evolution of our society, justifying harassment and straightforward
police control, and must be repealed, or profoundly modified, in order
to recognize the right of children and adolescents to maintain relations
with persons of their choice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 80 signatories included Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Jacques
Derrida, Roland Barthes, Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre, Félix
Guattari and Jean-François Lyotard.</p>
