            <p>This is a question about debate in science.</p>
<p>I’m not asking about <em>what</em> we disagree on, but if we do
disagree, <em>where</em> should we disagree?</p>
<p>Let’s imagine that the scientific authorities have a strong policy
that lacks good evidence, and might be harmful.</p>
<p>For example, what if the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov">US Centers for
Disease Control (CDC)</a> come out strongly in favor of masks for the
prevention of spread of Covid, despite weak to negative evidence of the
effectiveness of masks? And what if there was some reason to think that
masking children could cause harm? Or what if the CDC had a very strong
supportive policy on vaccines, to the extent that it failed to seriously
investigate obvious and serious side-effects?</p>
<p>Now let us imagine that — in that situation — 80% of researchers are
either: completely persuaded of the CDC case; not persuaded but think it
would be damaging to society to disagree; or not persuaded but
frightened of being labeled anti-Science or anti-vax. Now imagine you
are trying to publish a paper calling a CDC recommendation into
question. You are very likely to fail, because of peer review. You’ve
got to get through the editor, then at least two reviewers — assume the
opinions of each is independent, that’s a <span
class="math inline">0.2<sup>3</sup></span> = 0.8% chance that none of
the three will object. Even that chance requires that the CDC or other
persons in power have applied no extra influence on the editors to stay
on-message, “at least for now”.</p>
<p>You might think — it’s OK, if we want to argue our case, we can put
our papers up on preprint servers, but you would be wrong, because, for
example <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/about/FAQ">MedRxiv</a> has the
explicit policy to reject articles that “challenge … accepted public
health measures and advice”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All articles are screened on submission for … material that could
potentially endanger the health of individual patients or the public.
The latter may include, but is not limited to, studies describing
dual-use research of concern and works that challenge or could
compromise accepted public health measures and advice regarding
infectious disease transmission, immunization, and therapy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, say you, we can submit to BioRxiv instead. But no, it has an <a
href="https://www.biorxiv.org/about/FAQ">identical policy forbidding
disagreement with health authorities</a>.</p>
<p>Sure, say you, but we can always submit to the original-and-best <a
href="https://arxiv.org">arXiv</a>. That has no such policy. It only has
this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Submissions that do not contain original or substantive research,
including undergraduate research, course projects, and research
proposals, news, or information about political causes (even those with
potential special interest to the academic community) may be declined.
Papers that contain inflammatory or fictitious content (see also Code of
Conduct), or papers that use highly dramatic and misrepresentative
titles/abstracts/introductions may be declined. Papers in need of
significant review and revision may also be declined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And — even better - the linked <a
href="https://info.arxiv.org/help/policies/code_of_conduct.html">Code of
Conduct</a> has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>arXiv community members should uphold intellectual honesty and ethics
based on community and academic standards when writing and handling
scholarly works. We strive to be objective and transparent in our
decisions about policies, standards, and practices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in practice, there is good evidence that arXiv <em>does</em>
block articles that “challenge … accepted public health measures and
advice”, it’s just that they don’t do it in an “objective and
transparent” way.</p>
<p>First consider the experience of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ioannidis">John Ioannides</a>,
one of the most highly-cited authors in medicine. He <a
href="https://sensiblemed.substack.com/p/john-ioannidis-the-pandemic-as-of">describes
his experience</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In December 2020 I wrote a paper where, based on mathematical
modeling, I showed that once people started to increase their exposures
again, vaccines with modest effectiveness in halting transmission would
probably even lose all of their effectiveness for this outcome. medRxiv
declined to post my paper as a preprint claiming it was dealing with a
sensitive public health issue. arXiv also declined to post my paper as a
preprint, the message I received was stunning: “Our moderators have
determined that your submission is not of sufficient interest for
inclusion within arXiv. The moderators have rejected your submission
after examination, having determined that your article does not contain
sufficient original or substantive scholarly research.”</p>
<p>I sent an appeal and the reply was even more stunning: arXiv, a
preprint server, offered to post my paper as a preprint only AFTER it
had been published by a conventional peer-reviewed journal! I submitted
the paper to SSRN and then it got published in npj Vaccines, the
vaccines journal of Nature, several months later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Professors <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Fenton">Norman Fenton</a> and
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Martin-Neil-2">Martin
Neil</a> have given <a
href="https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/censored-by-the-academic-preprint">a
detailed account</a> of having multiple papers critical of official
analysis of Covid data being rejected both from MedRxiv, and from arXiv,
all with vague “not interesting, wrong type of thing” reasons given,
while all their non-Covid papers continued to be accepted.</p>
<p>Now — here’s the question. What happens next time? We already have
ample evidence that the governments of the <a
href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/3768087-former-nyt-columnist-bari-weiss-releases-twitter-files-part-two/">US</a>
and <a
href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/counter-disinformation-unit-open-source-information-collection-and-analysis-privacy-notice/counter-disinformation-unit-open-source-information-collection-and-analysis-privacy-notice">UK</a>,
at least, specifically acted to suppress voices critical of lockdown
policies.</p>
<p>You might believe — I would argue your beliefs were contrary to best
evidence — that masks are effective, lockdowns necessary and
proportionate, and mRNA vaccines are of net health benefit for young
men. But even so, you would have to accept that there is at least a
<em>chance</em> that government health bodies will give strong but
harmful advice <em>in the future</em>, and that it is very likely that
government bodies will again act to suppress scientific commentary and
criticism.</p>
<p>We can see that the current publishing models, including the preprint
servers, have failed at the task of allowing open scientific debate of
papers that (to quote the MedRxiv FAQ): “challenge or could compromise
accepted public health measures and advice regarding infectious disease
transmission, immunization, and therapy.”</p>
<p>I hope y’all agree that it would be a dangerous error to take the
same approach next time <em>even if you think the public health
authorities were entirely correct this time round</em>. But, if, like
me, you think the authorities gave too-simple advice, often to the point
of frank dishonesty, and then doubled-down when challenged, you will
feel even more strongly.</p>
<p>Assuming you agree we did not allow enough <em>scientific debate</em>
this time — where will this discussion happen next time? I mean, where
will we go for careful measured debate, with argument and
counter-argument? Where would we go for real, open, public
peer-review?</p>
<p>And, what do we need to do, to prepare the ground for a publishing
system that really applies science to the problem, rather than
power?</p>
