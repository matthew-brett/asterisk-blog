            <p>A colleague pointed me to a job advert to teach at a new university
in London: the <a
href="https://www.londoninterdisciplinaryschool.org">London
Interdisciplinary School</a>.</p>
<p>I was excited to see this was happening, because a new university may
well be the best way to make the change we need in science and
education.</p>
<p>The fundamental change we need is to <em>take computing
seriously</em>.</p>
<p>Taking computing seriously implies two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Code as the basis for data analysis</em></li>
<li><em>Disciplined working process as the basis for
collaboration</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t like reading long blog posts, skip to the blueprint at
the end; you may want to come back here for the background.</p>
<p>I have discussed these changes before in <a
href="https://matthew.dynevor.org/manifesto.html">Research methods in
the twenty-first century</a>.</p>
<section id="code-as-the-basis-for-data-analysis" class="level2">
<h2>Code as the basis for data analysis</h2>
<p>This is the true and fruitful meaning of the term <em>data
science</em> (see <a
href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/dsfe/chapters/01/what-is-data-science">What
is data science?</a>).</p>
<p>The insight has been most accurately captured by the data science
teaching initiatives at Berkeley – see <a
href="https://data.berkeley.edu/education"
class="uri">https://data.berkeley.edu/education</a>. Berkeley runs a
foundation course in data science, called <a
href="https://data.berkeley.edu/education/courses/data-8">data8</a>.
Quoting from that page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The course is designed for entry-level students from any major. It is
designed specifically for students who have not previously taken
statistics or computer science courses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The course teaches programming (in Python) as the fundamental tool
for analyzing data. It spends a lot of time thinking about plotting, and
about the nature of inference. Because it uses a programming language,
it can and does replace all classical statistical tests, such as
t-tests, with equivalents that use resampling. When the student knows
some code, resampling is much easier to explain than the classical
statistical tests <span class="citation"
data-cites="cobb2007introductory">(Cobb 2007)</span>; the students can
write the procedures for themselves, and fully understand all the steps,
including the inference at the end.</p>
<p>The Berkeley course does not cover “big data”, and that’s the right
thing to do. “Big data” is something you learn about when you have a
firm foundation in small data.</p>
<p>It does cover some machine learning and prediction, and does it very
well, but at the end, as another set of techniques for using data to
draw conclusions about the world. This is right too. No student should
start using machine learning without a good basic understanding of data
analysis, sampling and inference.</p>
<p>Berkeley uses this course as a foundation on which to build a whole
new approach to teaching. They have many <a
href="https://data.berkeley.edu/education/connectors">connector
courses</a> that use the same tools and techniques as the foundation
course, but apply them to areas such as law, statistics, computer
science, psychology and geography.</p>
<p>This is right too; we should teach with data. We should engage
students at once with the problem of real data, and the difficulties of
drawing conclusions. They should think about the ambiguities in data and
the conclusions we draw. They should learn to check all conclusions by
the instructor, or in a scientific paper, against the data. They should
constantly ask “Is that true? Under what circumstances is it true? How
sure am I, that it is true? How would I get more evidence to support or
refute this conclusion”.</p>
</section>
<section id="disciplined-working-process-as-the-basis-for-collaboration"
class="level2">
<h2>Disciplined working process as the basis for collaboration</h2>
<p>Working in collaboration on data analysis and other scientific
projects is very difficult, and we currently do that very badly. We need
to teach our students to start with sound, efficient practice, and keep
teaching them with this same practice, so it becomes natural for them to
use it for all new problems.</p>
<p>Science as currently practiced, and taught, uses what I would call an
<em>artisan</em> working process, or at least, that is the polite name
for it. A less polite description might be <em>sloppy, informal and
inefficient</em>. Our current model is that of the skilled craftsman,
from before the industrial revolution. The craft is so specialized,
variable and arcane, that the only way to learn is for the student to
copy the techniques they see during their apprenticeship. In science,
the apprenticeship is working as a graduate student or post-doc.
Scientists mostly work alone. The large proportion of scientists who use
a significant amount of computing, have disorganized, informal working
practice, passing around scripts and Word documents via email or via
shared drives. It is very hard to share work, because each researcher
has their own habits of analysis, coding, and data organization. There
is very little chance that the work will be reproducible, even by the
same researcher, after a few weeks, and little chance that a mentor will
be able to check the work for error.</p>
<p>This model is, of course, monstrously inefficient, confusing, and
error prone. It makes collaboration very difficult. It is easy to
underestimate the tendency of computers to confuse and distract.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, programmers in industry have found these same problems,
and they learned quickly that they couldn’t do efficient work that way.
When they tried, the result was bad software, poor collaboration and
inefficient production. They lost money.</p>
<p>In response, programmers have been thinking very hard about how to
work and collaborate efficiently. They found they needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>code testing</li>
<li>version control</li>
<li>continuous testing, with tests run for each code change</li>
<li>code review</li>
<li>issue tracking</li>
<li>pair coding</li>
</ul>
<p>Although these techniques evolved for writing commercial software,
they apply with the same force of necessity to the process of writing
scientific software. They also turn out to be revolutionary in improving
the process of building data analyses in a team. To those of us who have
experienced these techniques for doing scientific projects, returning to
the old email and track changes process feels like a return to the dark
ages, as if we had been forced to use a typewriter instead of a word
processor. The new techniques are much more effective in increasing
clarity, reducing error and improving discussion. I estimate they give a
ten-fold increase in efficiency for projects involving more than one
person, and a three-fold increase for someone working on their own.</p>
<p>Using these techniques is not advanced, it is where the students
should start. We have taught these techniques to statistics and other
undergraduates, in Berkeley <span class="citation"
data-cites="millman2018rcsds">(Millman et al. 2018)</span>. Our course
started with the basics of Python programming, then introduced the
techniques they would need for working together, such as version
control, and testing. We gave them a big, difficult, open-ended group
project to do. It had to be reproducible, so we, their graders, could
take their project repository (hosted on <a
href="https://github.com">Github</a>), and follow their instructions, in
a <code>README</code> file, to reproduce all of their analysis, and
build their final report, including the figures. If you read the paper,
I hope you will agree, that they did this with great success.</p>
</section>
<section id="blueprint-for-a-modern-university" class="level2">
<h2>Blueprint for a modern university</h2>
<p>I now imagine I can design a whole new set of courses, from the
ground up, to give the students the best possible foundation for modern
scientific work.</p>
<ul>
<li>The students start with something like the <a
href="https://data.berkeley.edu/education/courses/data-8">Berkeley
foundations of data science course</a>. They learn basic programming, in
Python. They learn to get data from real data sources and explore it
with plots and tables. They learn what models are, what inference means,
and how to make models and inferences with simulation and permutation.
They learn the bootstrap for estimation, and they get an introduction to
regression, and basic machine learning. They do a substantial open-ended
project using these tools at the end. They will learn in easy-start
tools like the <a href="https://jupyter.org">Jupyter Notebook</a>.</li>
<li>The students will specialize too. They specialize using the same
teaching methods as the data science foundation. If they are learning
about the epidemiology of malaria, they get epidemiological data and do
basic analysis. They get clinical trial data and draw conclusions. They
learn how to put data on maps, and visualize malaria incidence.</li>
<li>Their courses give them a deep foundation of understanding. For
example, when comparing the effect of two treatments for malaria, they
know how formulate the null model (there is no effect of the treatment),
and how to implement this model (by pooling the two treatment groups,
permuting, and selecting random samples as a proxy for the original
treatment groups). They know what it means to think of something as
random, and where the randomness appears in their model. They can use
random numbers and permutation to design new models to test new
hypotheses.</li>
<li>The deep foundation gives them deep skepticism. They know what it is
to understand something in depth, and they know the dangers of
superficial understanding, and following recipes. When they learn
something new, they learn it in depth, as they have learned in their
courses. They test their understanding, by building in code.</li>
<li>In the first or second year, they move on to techniques for
collaboration. Instead of Jupyter Notebooks, they start using more
efficient tools like text editors and the terminal. They learn version
control, and pull requests, and code review. They learn to formalize
problems in issues, and respond to problems with code changes, or by
finding new data for analysis. They learn to criticize each others’ work
constructively, and to teach new team members. They learn how to deal
with standard problems in the team, such as overconfident team members,
or members who are not doing their share of work. Now they are in a good
position to start collaborations with industry and academia.</li>
<li>As the students gain experience, they gain independence. They learn
to start quickly, using standard tools. They begin to contribute to
open-source, to support their analysis, and for their education, in
group work, and in coding.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this is a big departure from our current model of teaching, but I
don’t think any university will have a choice but to change in the
coming decade. These ways of learning and working are so much more
efficient than the techniques we are using now, that students who do not
learn them, will be at a great disadvantage. But that is not the only
issue; we need to prepare our students for a changing world. We are
entering a new age, in which complex data analysis will have an
increasing influence on our lives and our scientific understanding. If
we want to teach students to be effective and skeptical, we can’t afford
to use the old methods; we just don’t have time to bolt computing and
algorithms on top of our current courses. We must start with computing
and algorithms, to teach students to build and to understand. Then they
will have the tools to engage with confidence and vigor with the beasts
of the new age.</p>
